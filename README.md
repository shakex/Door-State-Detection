# Door State Detection

A software automatically detects the state of a door (if it is opened or closed) given a surveillance video as input. The algorithm goes through the following steps: Extract frames from video sequences; Feature extraction and description using several feature descriptors such as SIFT, SURF, ORB, FAST, etc.; Feature match and pattern detection; State judgement.
